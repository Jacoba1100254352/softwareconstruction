# Chess

![chess board](6-gameplay/highlight-moves.png)

We use the game of chess to help you develop and demonstrate mastery during this course. Your development work is
divided into six different phases. Each phase demonstrates a different architectural concept or technology.

| Phase            | Getting Started                                  | Requirements                            | Starter Code                        | Description                                                    |

## Starter Code

âš  Each phase of the project comes with `starter code`. In order to make it easy to copy the starter files to your
personal project repository, you should clone the course repository to your development environment.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/softwareconstruction240/softwareconstruction.git

```

## Deliverables

Every phase has different deliverables. You will deliver your code for each phase, but you will also meet with a TA to
interactively pass off most phases.

| Phase            | Deliverables                                                                                      |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Chess game    | Complete pass off tests for the chess game code.                                                  |
| 2. Server design | Create javadocs for the service and database components.                                          |
| 3. Web API       | Complete pass off tests for the HTTP server<br/>Create and complete unit tests for chess service. |
| 4. Database      | Create and complete unit tests for the chess database.                                            |
| 5. Pregame       | Create and complete client unit tests.                                                            |
| 6. Gameplay      | Complete pass off tests for WebSocket server.                                                     |

The deliverables in blue represent tests provided by the course start up code that you must pass. The deliverables in
green represent unit tests that you must write and pass.
